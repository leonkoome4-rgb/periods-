  <h2>What is a Menstrual Cycle?</h2>
  <p>
    A menstrual cycle is the monthly process that prepares a woman’s body for pregnancy.
    It starts on the first day of a period and ends on the day before the next period begins.
    The average menstrual cycle lasts about 28 days, but it can be shorter or longer
    depending on the person.

  <h2>How Do You Calculate Your Next Period?</h2>
  <p>
    To estimate the next period date, you need to know:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The first day of your last period</li>
    <li>Your average cycle length (number of days)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The next period date is calculated by adding the cycle length to the first day
    of the last period. For example, if your last period started on January 1st and
    your cycle length is 28 days, your next period is expected around January 29th.

  <h2>What Are Fertile and Safe Days?</h2>
  <p>
    Ovulation usually happens about 14 days before the next period. This is when a
    woman is most likely to get pregnant. The fertile window includes a few days
    before ovulation and one or two days after.
  </p>

  <p>
    Safe days are the days outside the fertile window when the chance of pregnancy
    is lower. However, this method is not 100% accurate because cycles can change.
